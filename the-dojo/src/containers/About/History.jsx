        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Since the 1930s, the Japanese Cultural Institute of Sawtelle taught kendo until the cultural animosity of World War II forced Japanese-Americans to shut down all practice of the art. After nearly a decade of inactivity, the West Los Angeles Kendo Dojo was officially founded on October 19th, 1952 . At its birth the dojo had only four kenshi, but membership grew rapidly. The first tournament was held only seven months later, and West LA Dojo became a prominent host for tournaments until the mid 70s.
